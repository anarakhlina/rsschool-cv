I'm a 3rd year student at BSU currently seeking employment. Despite being acquainted with head 
principles of OOP and algorithms and computer structures, I have advanced English skills and have 
worked with MySQL and Git. I'm a quick learner with critical thinking who can quickly adopt to 
various circumstances, absorb new ideas and communicate clearly and effectively.
