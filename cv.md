Throughout my four years at Belarussian State University, I developed great problem solving skills and obtained knowledge in computer science and mathematics. I have strong command of programming languages like C++, HTML, JavaScript, React, Python and SQL and continue to expand my coding experience by taking courses in my free time. My passion towards JavaScript led me to studying React, so I started working as a React Frontend Developer, where I gained some considerable work experience, ability to work well in a team and great communication skills.
